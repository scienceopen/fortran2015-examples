Easy examples of scientific computing with modern, powerful, easy Fortran 2018 standard.
Fortran 2018 began as the TS18508 extension, formerly known as Fortran 2015.

Modern Fortran benefits from modern CMake, which supports Fortran features such as

* [submodule](https://github.com/scivision/fortran-submodule)
* preprocessing
* detecting specific support of Fortran features (so users know their compiler is too old)

Based on widespread compiler support and beneficial features, most new and upgraded Fortran programs should use at least portions of the Fortran 2008 standard.

## Prereq

* Linux / Windows: `apt install cmake gfortran libhdf5-dev libopenmpi-dev libcoarrays-dev open-coarrays-bin`
* Mac: `brew install gcc cmake open-mpi opencoarrays`

## Build

The CMake or Meson build system automatically walks through the subdirectories:

### CMake

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --parallel

cd build
ctest --parallel --output-on-failure
```

### Meson

```sh
meson build

meson test -C build
```

## Compilers

### ifort Intel

Be sure you have the
[Intel Parallel Studio Cluster Edition](https://www.scivision.dev/install-intel-compiler-icc-icpc-ifort/)
that has `mpiifort`.

```bash
FC=ifort CC=icc CXX=icpc cmake ..
```

### Flang / Clang

[Flang](https://www.scivision.dev/flang-compiler-build-tips/) is a Free compiler.

```bash
FC=flang CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ..
```

### PGI

[PGI](https://www.scivision.dev/install-pgi-free-compiler/) is available at no cost.

```bash
FC=pgf90 CC=pgcc CXX=pgc++ cmake ..
```

## Companion libraries

## Bugs

### iso_fortran_env

Flang 6 and PGI 18.10 seem to have a bug with `iso_fortran_env` that doesn't allow `compiler_version` and `compiler_options` to work unless `use iso_fortran_env` is ONLY used in `program` and NOT `module` *even if* using `only`.
Thus, simple programs like `pragma.f90` work, but not the usual programs to print the compiler versions and options with Flang and PGI.
